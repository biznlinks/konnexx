But four of the nine Trump nominees scheduled for hearings this week still haven’t disclosed key financial information to the Office of Government Ethics, which is charged with making sure they don’t break federal ethics laws.\n\nOf the four nominees who had not submitted their ethics paperwork as of Monday afternoon, two of them ― Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross and Education Secretary-designate Betsy DeVos ― are billionaires who have never worked in government.\n\n“The announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me,” Office of Government Ethics director Walter Shaub wrote in a letter to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Saturday. It would “be cause for alarm,” Shaub added, “if the Senate were to go forward with hearings on nominees whose reports OGE has not certified.”\n\nThe other two nominees who haven’t yet submitted financial disclosures are former Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson, picked to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, chosen to head the Department of Homeland Security. Neither man is nearly as wealthy as Ross or DeVos.\n\nUntil 2015, Kelly received a salary from the U.S. Marine Corps and was effectively prohibited from drawing income from the private sector. Carson already submitted detailed financial disclosure forms to the Federal Election Commission as part of his presidential campaign. They reveal that Carson’s wealth is derived largely from speaking fees and book sales.\n\n                                \n\n                                \n                            \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                Categories\n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                            \n                            \n                                Recent Posts\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                            Trump Picks Blows Of Vetting...\n                                        \n                                        Jan 09 2017\n                                    \n                                  \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                            Lupita Nyong’o takes Vogue to Kenya, speaks on Race in Hollywood...\n                                        \n                                        Jan 10 2017","tags":"Konnexx Limited","loc":"/news/trump-picks-blows-of-vetting/"},
